# Introduction

## Who I am?

Hi! I'm Maria Gabriela Bohórquez. Currently studying Electronics Engineering in Simón Bolívar University in Caracas, Venezuela. I work mainly in Robotics projects with interests on Machine Learning, Network and IoT Security, and Social Startups. 

I can be contacted either by my email: gabriellabohorquez@gmail.com or by [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mgbohorquez).

## What will I work on?

My main goal is to make Robocomp more open to the general public. Robocomp would be benefited from offering a better user experience for beginners with better tutorials and a more seamlessly transition for collaborators to work on it.

### On my First Month I will:

- Implement new tutorials in the area of Installation Guides for Windows and various Linux distros.
- Improve the ReadtheDocs. Look for errors and start moving and rewriting stuff. For example I have to check what is wrong with the tutorial on the [highlyunstable branch](http://robocomp.readthedocs.io/en/highlyunstable/#robocomp).
- Personalize the existing [Contribute.md](https://github.com/robocomp/web/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) page and create a pull request template to make it easier to contribute in an orderly way.
- Write a new About page. This needs to be done with a lot of time to review it until it conveys the "Why --> How --> What" of Robocomp perfectly.

For more details on my proposal you can see the [GSoC page](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#6500790261252096) or the more detailed version of this post on my personal [website](https://github.com/mariabohorquez/mariabohorquez.github.io/blob/master/_posts/2018-04-25-GSoC-Accepted.md).
